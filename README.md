# Exercism-js

My exercism solutions.  

## JavaScript/TypeScript
- Solutions are written in TypeScript in `[src]`(typescript/src).
- Tests are written in TypeScript in `[test]`(typescript/test).
- Code is finally transpiled to ES6 (a.k.a. ES2015) in `[dist]`(typescript/dist).
- If tests pass, copy the transpiled file from `dist` to the appropriate JavaScript challenge in `javascript/`, then `exercism submit javascript/xyz/abc.js`
